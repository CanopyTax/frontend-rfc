# Master Based Development (MBD)
- Start Date: Sometime in mid/late 2015
- RFC PR: https://github.com/CanopyTax/frontend-rfc/pull/1

## Squad vs Chapter vs Frontend-wide
All squads should use master based development as their branching scheme for deployed services.

- This is a Canopy-wide stance for both backend and frontend development.
- 

## Other options

## Common practices (not enforced)
- Only use branches for code reviewing, not for other devs to be able to pull down your code.
