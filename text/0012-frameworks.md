# Frameworks at Canopy
- RFC PR: https://github.com/CanopyTax/frontend-rfc/pull/12

## Squad vs Chapter vs Frontend-wide
Before using a framework outside our [supported frameworks](#supported-frameworks), squads should follow the path outlined 
in [Introducing a new framework](#introducing-a-new-framework).

## Definition
A UI framework is a library that creates DOM elements (e.g. React, Angular, Vue). Most of the most popular frameworks have an
implmentation of a "component" building block for creating user interfaces. On the frontend at Canopy we've embraced 
microservices that could be written in any framework (polyglot) instead of a single framework that everything must be built in.

## Reason for decision
Whenever a single framework is chosen it becomes the "core" of the application. It pushes us towards a single ecosystem and 
a single set of solutions. This works very well until that framework changes, either from a big rewrite (AngularJS -> Angular), 
the framework is no longer supported, or a new framework solves our problems better.

To avoid a cycle of framework migrations we've intentionally chosen to avoid locking ourselves into a specific framework and 
becoming an `${frameworkX} shop`. We've done this with a microservices approach. This has come with a lot of pros and cons. 
Our goal is for the best tools to "bubble up", rather than be selected and pushed "top down".

When a new customer facing feature is being built, it's important to recognize that introducing a new framework comes with a 
lot of costs and we have to manage those costs across the entire front-end. New frameworks should be added with care and, as a 
result, doing so isn't a squad level decision.

Introducing a new framework requires your colleagues to understand the framework paradigm in order to make changes, fix bugs, or properly 
respond to an alert.

## Why can we be so flexible with frameworks
- [single-spa](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa)
- [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)
- [SOFE](https://github.com/CanopyTax/sofe)

### pros of our Polyglot/micro-services approach
- Easy to build, experiment, and change our tech stack.
- We aren't locked into Angular or React.
- We can, theorectially, choose the best framework for the job.
- Avoid product rewrites until the product needs to change.

### cons of our Polyglot/micro-services approach
- It could become the wild west of frameworks, where each squad uses frameworks/tools that no one else has any familiarity with.
- Bundle size if multiple frameworks need to be downloaded (initial load time performance)
- Could affect hiring (Squad X has an opening but they use Framework Y so we have to hire a Y specialist)
- Standardized and sharable components / styles
- Less ability to transfer between squads

### Managing our cons
- Limit ["fully supported"](supported-frameworks) frameworks
- Code splits and lazy loading
- Use webcomponents for styleguide components so any framework can use them
- Invest in tooling and DX (developer experience)

## Supported Frameworks
### definition
A suppoted framework at Canopy is one that is already being used extensively. You can expect an easier path when using these 
frameworks since there is already a lot of infrastructure and tooling in place for them. When choosing a framework to use 
for a project, the supported frameworks can be used without going through the [Introducing a New Framework process](#introducing-a-new-framework)
### Fully Supported Frameworks
- React
- AngularJS (legacy)

We're currently moving away from AngularJS and have bubble-up standardized on React. We have a few experiments in Vue and 
Svelte but they aren't something we're fully committed to introducing into our application yet.

## Introducing a new framework
This is something that isn't well defined yet. Previous discussions have lead to a loose process resembling this:

  - Evaluate options (squad)
  - Build Squad consensus
  - Discuss it with Chapter lead
  - Build some consensus frontend-wide
  - Get approval from chapter leads
  - Schedule a frontend training on the new framework.
