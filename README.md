# Canopy Frontend RFC
The Canopy Frontend RFC (Request for Comments) is a git repository where the technologies and processes that apply to all
frontend squads at Canopy are described.

## Purpose
1. Provide a way to enact change in Canopy's frontend that impacts all projects and squads.
2. Clarify what things we are aligned on across the entire front-end, so that everything else can be decided by the members of each squad.

## What this isn't
1. An infringement on the autonomy of squads. The idea is that if we're aligned on the few important things, we can be autonomous on everything else.
2. Something oppressively prescriptive.
3. A technical review process where people get feedback on difficult problems they're facing. Although important, the RFC is not how
   technical reviews happen.

## Signs that this is working
1. The content is up-to-date and people care about it.
2. There are regular updates.
3. Things are regularly removed.
4. We change the process when it's annoying or doesn't work well.
5. Ideas have a safe place to develop before being criticized.

## Signs that this isn't working
1. This blocks people from getting stuff done.
2. Ivory tower gatekeeping.
3. Changes are discouraged instead of encouraged.
4. "Well that's just the way it is."
5. The process is heavy, bureaucratic, or long.

## What to do if the RFC isn't working
Propose a change to the process!

## Process for change
**Anyone** at Canopy can propose a change.

### Step 1 - Idea
During the idea phase, we should encourage instead of critique. A person can use the #frontend-rfc slack channel
to discuss, clarify, and foster an idea. We should examine with an open mind the pros and cons, options, and implementation.

Another part of the idea phase is asking the question "Should this be autonomous to the squads or enforced consistently in all squads?"

### Step 2 - Proposal
A proposal is a pull request to this git repository. Here, an idea is debated and discussed by anyone who wants to participate. Reviewers can make comments
asking for changes or they can challenge the basis of the proposal.

If a pull request becomes stale, close it.

### Step 3 - Approval
Once the author and reviewers have commented and the discussion and proposal have stabilized, the proposal will be merged or closed. The process for approval
will start out fairly loose and can be refined over time. To start out, we'll shoot for consensus among all participants and fallback to chapter leads helping
to make the decision if consensus doesn't happen.

### Step 4 - Implementation
Once a proposal is merged, it is now part of the RFC. The changes or additions to the RFC apply to the whole frontend and we should make whatever
changes are needed to our code, processes, and organization.
